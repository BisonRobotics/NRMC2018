I'm going to get started on a simple model in VREP of the robot. Can someone give me an estimate of the dimensions of the frame, wheels, and wheel locations?

how critical is it that the dimensions you get now match what is actually used?

Not very, I just want to get some basic simulation stuff going so Nicole can get started.

lets say 12" wheels 4" in width with the wheel centers 27" apart from each other in both directions
